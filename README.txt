THIS IS THE OFFICIAL API / SERVER FOR THE CLOTHING AND ECOMMERCE WEBSITE

ABOUT THE GOOGLE AUTH PROCESS --->

NOTE ON GOOGLE AUTH: 
// first the frontend request for the server side rendered google page which here represents
by 'http:localhost:8080/api/v1/auth/google' - Obviously this will only work if the server has a auth route for same if not it will throw error. Also, the http:localhost:8080 or the client side domian name should be present on the google developer console javascript engine so that google oauth2 know that this domain is okay to be usign this auth portal if not it will throw error.
// Once the google oauth2.0 portal is called and right google account is used then the callbackUrl in the googleStrategy will be called which means 'http://localhost:8080/api/v1/auth/google/callback' this should be also correctly registered in google developer console in the authorized redirect uri if not it will throw an error . Also this will only work if the callbackUrl auth route is available.One more nuance that the callbackUrl route will only be called once the function in new GoogleStratery is successfullly passed and the following succesful callback/done is called otherwise it will never be called and thus the choose any account google portal will only be loading and never be redirecting to any links. 


NOTES ON TODO ----> 
// :TODO(p) denotes a thing that needs priority as should be atleast looked before pushing in prod
// :TODO(l) donotes things that isnt the most high priority and is going to be done to improve the functionality of the api and improve UX, thus could be done in later versions.
// :TODO(q) dentoes something which is a question should be thought before production

security issue if someone manually copy and paste the tokens
Short Token Lifetimes: Set short expiration times for the JWT tokens. This reduces the window of opportunity for an attacker to misuse a copied token.

Token Revocation: Implement token revocation mechanisms to invalidate tokens if they are compromised or suspected of being misused. This can be done by maintaining a token blacklist or using token revocation lists (CRLs) or token revocation endpoints.

Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Implement additional layers of security, such as MFA, to strengthen the authentication process. MFA requires users to provide multiple forms of identification, making it harder for attackers to gain unauthorized access.

IP Address Verification: Bind the token to the user's IP address, making it valid only from that specific IP. This adds an extra layer of protection against token misuse.

Contextual Authorization: Implement fine-grained access control and authorization mechanisms on the server side. Validate not only the token but also the user's permissions and roles to ensure they have appropriate access to protected resources.

User Education: Educate your users about the importance of keeping their tokens secure and the risks associated with copying and sharing tokens. Encourage them to follow security best practices and report any suspicious activity.

While these measures significantly improve the security of your application, it's important to regularly assess and update your security measures to adapt to evolving threats and vulnerabilities.

Remember, security is a continuous process, and no solution is entirely foolproof. It requires a combination of technological measures, user awareness, and ongoing monitoring to mitigate risks effectively.

WHen fetching getCartItems we can check whether if we want a condition where only user that is logged in can only get its own cart details(probably);
